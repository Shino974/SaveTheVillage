- ## Description
This game was made during my year in Korea at Keimyung University for the mid-terms.
The game was made with Unity and the assets are royalty-free.
In the repository you'll find all the source code and assets, which you can reuse free of charge.

- ## Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.3.13f1 or higher
- Visual studio or any IDE with .NET
- Windows operating system

- ## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Shino974/SaveTheVillage.git
  - Add the project with Unity 
  - Start the project (for debug mode) or go to file -> Build and run (for an .exe)

- ## Usage
You can move around with the arrow keys.
The game is fairly intuitive, but if you're having trouble, here's a step-by-step guide:
- Talk to the princess in the middle-left corner of the first map.
- Collect 3 white flowers
- Return to the princess
- Go XP on the 2 other maps near the top of the first village (each mob killed gives you a level which gives you 5 stats with which you can increase your life and strength by pressing the escape key).
- :warning: Be careful: you lose one HP per battle, so you need to increase it at the end of each fight.
- Once you've killed a dozen or so mobs, you can move on to the second village to the left of the first, on the top right.

Thanks for downloading this project, if you liked it you can star it and if you have any other questions I let you contact me on Instagram.
